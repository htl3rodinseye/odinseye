# OdinsEye

OdinsEye is a Program to help beginners learn to use the UNIX Shell as easily as possible.

The application itself is written in Rust, because it is pretty low-level and therefore ideal for reading and writing from and to the terminal.

## How it works

As soon as the program is executed it will generate a new folder in the users home-directory. This directory will act as the **/**-directory in typical UNIX systems.

The application will send a GET-requets to our backend and retrieve a JSON-file containing all information necessary to build an exercise for the users to do.

Such a file typically contains the exercises **id, name, root, and folder/file-structure.**
